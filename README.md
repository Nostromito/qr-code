## Overview

A recreation attempt at front end mentors qr code, used for learning and constructive critisism. This is my first try at writing a code correctly and used for figuring out where I need help through the community. Thanks!

## My process

My process started with confidently believing I had a basic understanding on how to complete this simple project, and then quickly realising I have no idea what im doing. Many youtube videos later and this is what I created.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned to use padding and solid borders to help understand how my boxes work and to adjust as needed.

<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>

* {
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
}


### Continued development

What I believe I still need work on is proper times to use display grid vs flex. Centering items within components seems to be a weak spot for me.
